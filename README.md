So here is the overview of this project 

Import data from an Excel spreadsheet, process it, and perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The script starts by setting up the import options for the spreadsheet, specifying the sheet, data range, column names, and variable types. It imports the data from "Sheet1" of the Excel file and ensures that numerical variables (such as sales, quantity, discount, and profit) are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 for uniformity. Afterward, categorical variables (like order ID and country) are converted to categorical data types for easier handling.

Once the data is imported, normalized, and categorized, the script proceeds to compute the covariance matrix of the numerical variables. PCA is performed by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order, and the top two eigenvectors (principal components) are selected to form a feature vector. The centered data (after subtracting the mean) is projected onto these principal components, reducing the dimensionality. The script then visualizes the recast data in a scatter plot along the two principal components. Additionally, a loading plot is generated to show how each original variable (sales, quantity, discount, and profit) contributes to the first two principal components, allowing for easier interpretation of the data.
